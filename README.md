# UniTrain
UniTrain is an open-source, unified platform for effortless machine learning model training, evaluation, and deployment across diverse tasks. Experience seamless experimentation and model deployment with UniTrain.

## Installation instruction  
### Install the **UniTrain** module using:  
```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ UniTrain==0.2.3```    

### Install **torch** library using:  
```pip install torch```    

**Note** : You can use your local device or any online notebooks like *Google Colab* or *Kagle* for training the models, as explained below.<br>
However,using 'Google Colab' would be preferred because of its simple user-friendly interface and the computing power that it brings with itself.

**Note**: For *Google Colab* use "!" before every command.  


## Training  
### Classification  
**Adding Data for Training**    
- Create a "data" folder within a "content" folder.  
- The "data" folder will contain three different folders named "train", "test" and "eval" used for training, testing, and evaluation purposes.  
- Each of the "train", "test" and "eval" folders contains data sets of different categories on which you want to use your model
- Data folder structure content->data->(train, test, eval)->(category1, category2, category3, .....)
    
**Training the model**
- Run the following code to train your model and you can change the default arguments with your custom arguments  

```
import UniTrain
from UniTrain.utils.classification import get_data_loader, train_model
from UniTrain.models.classification import ResNet9
from UniTrain.utils.classification import parse_folder
import torch

if parse_folder("/content/data/"):
  train_dataloader = get_data_loader("/content/data/", 32, True, split='train')
  test_dataloader = get_data_loader("/content/data/", 32, True, split='test')

  model = ResNet9(num_classes=6)
  model.to(torch.device('cuda'))

  train_model(model, train_dataloader, test_dataloader,
              num_epochs=10, learning_rate=1e-3, checkpoint_dir='checkpoints',logger = "training.log", device=torch.device('cuda'))
```

## Segmentation  
**Adding Data for Training**  
- Create a "data" folder within a "content" folder.  
- The "data" folder will contain three different folders named "train", "test" and "eval" used for training, testing, and evaluation purposes.  
- Each of the "train", "test" and "eval" folders contains data sets of different categories on which you want to use your model

import UniTrain
from UniTrain.utils.classification import get_data_loader, train_model
from UniTrain.models.classification import ResNet9
from UniTrain.utils.classification import parse_folder

if parse_folder("/content/data/"):
  train_dataloader = get_data_loader("/content/data/", 32, True, split='train')
  test_dataloader = get_data_loader("/content/data/", 32, True, split='test')

  model = ResNet9(num_classes=6)
  model.to(torch.device('cuda'))

  train_model(model, train_dataloader, test_dataloader,
              num_epochs=10, learning_rate=1e-3, checkpoint_dir='checkpoints',logger = "training.log", device=torch.device('cuda'))
```

### DCGAN

**Adding Data for Training**  
- For the data create a folder 'data'->'realimages'->'images'-> Add your data here
- No need to create fake images as it would be generated by the untrained generator  

**Training the model ( both discriminator and generator )**  
- Run the following code to train your model and you can change the default arguments with your custom arguments  

```
import UniTrain
from UniTrain.utils.DCGAN import parse_folder, get_data_loader, train_model
from UniTrain.models.DCGAN import disc , gen
import glob
import torch

def main():
  result = parse_folder('data')
  if result:

    real_image_paths = glob.glob("data/real_images/images/*.jpg")
    real_image_paths = glob.glob("data/real_images/images/*.png")
    real_image_paths = glob.glob("data/real_images/images/*.jpeg")
    
    train_dataloader = get_data_loader('data', 128 )
    discriminator_model = disc.discriminator
    generator_model = gen.generator
    train_model( discriminator_model, generator_model, train_dataloader, batch_size = 128 ,  num_epochs = 25, learning_rate = 1e-3, torch.device('cpu'),checkpoint_dir='checkpoints')

  else:
    print("Invalid dataset folder.")
    return None

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
